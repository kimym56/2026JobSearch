## 🌤️ Afternoon Block: Frontend Prep - Core Learning

**Time:** 1:00 PM – 4:00 PM
_Focus: Integrated learning (Concept → Apply → Explain)_

### 1:00 - 2:00: Learn Concept - React State Management Patterns

**Focus:** Understanding when to use useState vs useReducer vs Context

- [x] Read React docs: "Managing State" section (30 min)
  - https://react.dev/learn/managing-state
  - Focus: State organization principles, lifting state

- [x] Read React docs: "Extracting State Logic into a Reducer" (20 min)
  - https://react.dev/learn/extracting-state-logic-into-a-reducer
  - Focus: When useReducer simplifies complex state logic

- [ ] Take structured notes (10 min)
  - useState: Simple, independent state
  - useReducer: Complex state with multiple sub-values or next state depends on previous
  - Context: Sharing state across component tree without prop drilling

**Key Learnings to Note:**

- When state updates depend on previous state → useReducer
- When multiple state pieces update together → useReducer
- When state needs to be shared → Context (often with useReducer)

### 2:00 - 3:00: Apply via Coding - Build Complex Form with useReducer

**Task:** Build a registration form with validation using useReducer

- [ ] Create form component with useReducer (15 min)
  - State: { username, email, password, confirmPassword, errors, touched }
  - Actions: SET_FIELD, TOUCH_FIELD, VALIDATE, RESET

- [ ] Implement validation logic (15 min)
  - Username: 3-20 characters
  - Email: Valid email format
  - Password: 8+ characters, uppercase, lowercase, number
  - ConfirmPassword: Matches password

- [ ] Add form submission handling (10 min)
  - Prevent default if errors exist
  - Display success message on valid submit

- [ ] Review and test (5 min)

### 3:00 - 4:00: Explain Aloud

**Task:** Record yourself explaining the form implementation

- [ ] Record 5-minute explanation (5 min)
  - "Why useReducer instead of useState here?"
  - "How does the reducer handle multiple validation rules?"
  - "What are the benefits of this pattern for forms?"

- [ ] Identify gaps (10 min)
  - Did I struggle explaining when to use Context?
  - Can I clearly explain reducer pattern to someone else?

- [ ] Note follow-up topics (15 min)
  - Context API deep dive (when to combine Context + useReducer)
  - Performance optimization with useMemo/useCallback
  - Form libraries comparison (React Hook Form, Formik)

### 🚶 Break (4:00 – 4:30 PM)

**Task:** Build an accordion component (45 min strict)

- [ ] Requirements (5 min)
  - Multiple collapsible sections
  - Click header to toggle expand/collapse
  - Only one section open at a time (or multiple - your choice)
  - Smooth transitions/animations
  - Accessible: ARIA attributes

- [ ] Implementation (35 min)

### 🚶 Break (10:00 – 10:30 PM)

### 10:30 - 11:00: Book Reading (Inside React Deep Dive)

- [ ] Chapter 08: [Topic from book] (20-30 min)
  - Light reading, integration time
  - Connect to today's state management learning

- [ ] Take brief notes on key insights

### 11:00 - 12:00: Pattern Review + Practice

- [ ] Review sliding window patterns from morning (15 min)
  - Fixed-size window vs. variable-size window
  - Window expansion: Add elements until condition met
  - Window contraction: Remove elements until condition valid again

- [ ] 1 light problem: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters (3, M) (30 min)
  - Classic sliding window with character set tracking
  - Focus: Window contraction logic

- [ ] Quick comparison with hash map approach (15 min)
  - Sliding window: O(n) time, O(k) space (k = character set size)
  - Hash map: May also be O(n) but sliding window is more elegant for this problem

### 12:00 - 12:30: Review & Mistakes

- [ ] Document mistakes from today:
  - Form validation: Took longer than expected on error message display
  - Tabs component: Forgot ARIA attributes initially, had to add them
  - Accordion animation: Struggled with height transition from 0 to auto

- [ ] Top 3 learnings:
  1. useReducer shines when state updates are complex or interdependent
  2. Sliding window requires clear condition for when to expand vs. contract
  3. Component accessibility (ARIA) should be planned from the start, not added later

- [ ] Tomorrow's focus:
  - Context API deep dive (when to share state across tree)
  - Prefix sum algorithms (Day 9)
  - Lab night preparation (light evening only)

## 🧮 Algorithms Solved (Night Before - From Day 7 Evening)

Problems solved in evening review session:

1. Minimum Size Subarray Sum (209, M) - Sliding Window - 45 min
   - Approach: Variable-size window, expand while sum < target, contract while sum >= target
   - Key insight: Track minimum length when sum condition is met
   - Difficulty: Edge case when no valid subarray exists

2. Permutation in String (567, M) - Sliding Window - 30 min
   - Approach: Fixed-size window (length of s1), compare character counts
   - Key insight: Use array of 26 for count comparison (faster than hash map)
   - Difficulty: Optimizing count comparison (can use matches counter instead of full compare)

Patterns practiced:

- Pattern 1: Variable-size sliding window (min size subarray)
- Pattern 2: Fixed-size sliding window (permutation check)
- Character count array optimization (26 letters vs. hash map)

Difficulties encountered:

- Window contraction logic: When to shrink vs. when to expand
- Edge cases: No valid subarray, single character, all same characters
- Optimization: Can we avoid comparing entire count arrays each time?

---

## 💡 Key Patterns & Learnings

Today's key insights:

1. **Sliding Window - Variable Size**: Minimum Size Subarray Sum uses window that expands until sum >= target, then contracts from left until sum < target. Track minimum length when condition is met. O(n) time because each element added/removed at most once.

2. **Sliding Window - Fixed Size**: Permutation in String uses fixed-size window (length of s1). Slide window across s2, compare character counts. Optimization: Track matches count instead of comparing entire arrays.

3. **React State - useReducer Pattern**: useReducer simplifies complex state logic, especially when:
   - Next state depends on previous state
   - Multiple state pieces update together
   - Complex validation logic (forms)
   - Benefits: Predictable state updates, easier to test, cleaner action logs

4. **Component Patterns - Tabs vs Accordion**: Both use index-based state but differ in complexity:
   - Tabs: Simple, no animation needed, ARIA attributes straightforward
   - Accordion: Requires height animation (0 → auto tricky), more content handling
   - Shared pattern: Compound component structure (Parent + children)

5. **Accessibility Planning**: ARIA attributes should be designed from start, not added later. Tabs need role="tablist"/"tab"/"tabpanel", aria-selected, aria-controls. Keyboard navigation (arrow keys) important for usability.

6. **Integrated Learning Effectiveness**: Learn → Apply → Explain structure reinforced understanding:
   - Morning: Read docs on state management
   - Afternoon: Built form with useReducer, struggled through implementation
   - Evening: Explained reasoning aloud, identified gaps in Context knowledge

Connections to previous days:

- Sliding window extends two-pointer pattern (Day 7) but with condition-based window size
- State management builds on React fundamentals (useState from earlier)
- Component patterns (tabs/accordion) prepare for advanced challenges (carousel, data table)

Questions to revisit:

- When to use Context vs. prop drilling for specific scenarios?
- How to optimize sliding window when condition check is expensive?
- Component composition: When to use compound components vs. render props vs. hooks?
