# Full-Stack Engineer Preparation - Side Project + Frontend Job Prep (Rescheduled v8 - Compressed to Mar 05)

Start date: Monday, Jan 26, 2026
End date: Thursday, Mar 05, 2026
Weekends (Sat/Sun) are rest days.

## Scheduling Rules (Must Follow)
- Day starts at 10:00am.
- **10:00am**: Daily side project colleague sync (10-30 minutes).
- **10:30am-11:45am**: Algorithm study DISCUSSION (review problems solved in previous evening with colleagues) on scheduled days only.
- Weekdays daytime: side project work with algorithm block intermixed.
- After 7:00pm: frontend job prep rotation (React docs, coding assignments, interview questions, applications) (except Wed/Thu with early dinners before activities).
- Every Wednesday: Pilates 6:00-11:00pm; home around 11:00-11:30pm.
  - Wednesday nights (11:30pm-1:00am): Solve 2 algorithm problems for Thursday morning discussion.
  - Time is tight but sufficient for focused problem-solving.
- Every Thursday: Creative Vibe Coding Lab 6:30-10:00pm; home around 11:00-11:30pm.
  - Thursday nights are intentionally light (11:30pm-1:00am only).
- React study must use the official React docs as the primary source.
- Book reading: 20-30 minutes on Tuesday + Thursday nights.
- Portfolio site is low priority (only 1 short slot/week if core tasks are on track).
- Schedule length: 29 working days (weekends off).
- **Algorithm study schedule**:
  - Evening (Day N): Solve 2 problems independently (8:30-10:00 PM)
  - Morning (Day N+1): Discuss previous evening's problems (10:30-11:45 AM)
  - Study days: Feb 2-6, 9-13, 19-20, 23-27 (17 days total)

## Goals (High Level)
- Build strong React implementation skills through hands-on coding assignments.
- Maintain steady algorithm practice (LeetCode / Programmers / Baekjoon).
- Prepare interview questions + mock interviews in parallel with applications.
- Ship side project milestones on schedule (coordinated via daily syncs).

## Side Project Work (Daytime)
Side project work is coordinated via daily colleague syncs at 10:00am. The detailed roadmap and milestones are tracked through daily collaboration rather than a static schedule.

## Frontend Job Prep Plan (Evenings After 7pm)

### Evening Rotation (Parallel Tracks by Day)
Use the same daily template, but rotate focus by day so everything moves in parallel.

**Algorithm Study in Block 1:**
- On algorithm study days: First 90 min (8:30-10:00 PM) = Solve 2 LeetCode problems
- Remaining 30 min (10:00-10:30 PM) = Other Block 1 tasks
- On non-study days: Full 2 hours for other Block 1 tasks

| Day | 8:30 - 10:30 (Block 1: Algorithm + Other) | 11:00 - 12:15 (Block 2) | 12:30 - 1:00 (Review Block) |
|-----|------------------------|------------------------|----------------------------|
| Monday | Coding-assignment interview prep | Interview questions (JS/React/web) | Review mistakes + pattern study |
| Tuesday | React official docs study | Coding-assignment reps (timed) | Pattern review + 1-2 light problems |
| Wednesday | Pilates night (no standard rotation) | Light review only | Light only (1 easy max) |
| Thursday (lab night) | Algorithm study AM only, light PM review (11:30pm-1:00am) | Light review only | Light only (1 easy max) |
| Friday | Job search + applications | Mock interview (assignment or questions) | Timed set + weekly review |

Wednesday rule override:
- Pilates runs 6:00-11:00pm. Replace the standard rotation with **light review only** from 11:30pm-1:00am.

Thursday rule override:
- Lab runs 6:30-10:00pm. Replace the standard rotation with **light review only** from 11:30pm-1:00am.

Portfolio site (low priority):
- Use one short slot per week by replacing part of Friday Block 2, only if core tasks are on track.

### Book Reading Plan (다시 깊게 익히는 인사이드 리액트 - Inside React Deep Dive)
**Book Title:** 다시 깊게 익히는 인사이드 리액트 (Inside React Deep Dive)
Keep this lightweight and consistent: 20-30 minutes on Tuesday and Thursday nights.

Chapter pacing by week:
- Week 1 (Jan 26-30): Part 1, Chapters 01-05
- Week 2 (Feb 2-6): Part 2, Chapters 06-09
- Week 3 (Feb 9-13): Part 2, Chapters 10-12
- Week 4 (Feb 16-20): Part 3, Chapters 13-15
- Week 5 (Feb 23-27): Part 3, Chapters 16-17 + Part 4, Chapter 18
- Week 6 (Mar 2-5): Part 4, Chapter 19 + full review notes

How to fit it into the rotation:
- Tuesday: use the first 20-30 minutes of Block 2 for the book, then continue the planned task.
- Thursday (light): use the first 20-30 minutes of the 11:30pm-1:00am light review block for the book.

### Mock Interview Schedule
**Purpose:** Practice coding assignments and interview questions under realistic conditions

**Week 2-3: 1 mock interview per week**
- Focus: Coding assignment OR basic questions (alternate)
- Format: Self-recorded or with partner
- Duration: 45-60 minutes
- Schedule: Pick one evening slot (Friday recommended)
- Goal: Get comfortable with interview format

**Week 4-5: 2 mock interviews per week**
- Focus: Alternating between assignments and questions
  - Session 1: Coding assignment (timed, 45 min)
  - Session 2: Interview questions (technical + behavioral, 60 min)
- Format: Mix of self-recorded and partner sessions
- Duration: 60 minutes each
- Schedule: Spread across week (e.g., Tuesday + Friday)
- Goal: Build stamina and clear communication under time pressure

**Week 6: 3 mock interviews (final prep)**
- Focus: Full simulation (assignment + questions + behavioral)
- Format: Partner sessions preferred
- Duration: 75-90 minutes each
- Schedule: Mon, Wed, Fri (or Tue, Thu, Sat)
- Goal: Interview-day simulation, realistic conditions

**Rotation Pattern:**
- Odd-numbered sessions: Coding assignment (choose from `coding-challenge-progress.md`)
- Even-numbered sessions: Interview questions (JS/React/web/system design)

**Self-Recording Setup:**
- Use screen recording + voice capture
- Review recording afterwards for:
  - Clear communication
  - Time management
  - Code organization
  - Questions to ask interviewer
- Note: Be critical but kind in review

**Partner Mock Interview Best Practices:**
- Take turns being interviewer/interviewee
- Provide specific feedback (communication, code quality, problem-solving)
- Simulate real interview conditions (time limits, no external resources)
- Debrief: What went well? What to improve?

**Mock Interview Log Template:**
```markdown

## Notes
- If a Wednesday or Thursday night is too late, move the remaining tasks to the next evening.
- Keep weekends fully off to avoid burnout.
- Use the day map to keep the timeline aligned with actual dates.
- Algorithm study happens at 10:30 AM on scheduled days; evenings are for review and pattern study.
