## 🧮 Algorithms Solved (Night Before)

Problems solved in evening review session:
_(Day 5 was Friday Jan 30 - no evening session, so this section is empty)_

## Patterns practiced:

## Difficulties encountered:

---

## 💡 Key Patterns & Learnings

Today's key insights:

1. **Arrays & Strings - Hash Map Pattern**: Two Sum demonstrates O(n) solution using hash map vs O(n²) brute force. Key insight: trade space for time.
2. **Arrays & Strings - Vertical Scanning**: Longest Common Prefix can be solved by comparing characters column-by-column rather than finding the shortest string first.
3. **Side Project Progress**: Implementation work on project features.

Connections to previous days:

- Hash map pattern connects to earlier array problems
- Map integration builds on component state management from Week 1

Questions to revisit:

- Optimize Two Sum solution (currently marked suboptimal)
- Consider alternative approaches for Longest Common Prefix (divide and conquer)

## Notes

### Side Project Tomorrow

- Tasks to be determined during morning sync

### Job Prep Tomorrow (Tuesday)
