## Notes

- **🚫 No LeetCode today** — Focus is on building React muscle memory with complex state management
- This is a work day, so schedule is split between part-time work and studying
- End time is 1:00 AM - plan accordingly for rest

---

## Learning Goals

1. **React State Management**: Practice handling arrays in state (todos list)
2. **React Lists**: Master the `.map()` function and `key` prop
3. **HTML/CSS Foundation**: Solidify understanding of semantic HTML and box model
4. **CSS Layouts**: Get comfortable with both Flexbox and Grid
5. **Complex Components**: Build a fully functional Todo component with CRUD operations

---

## Tips for Success

- When building the List component, remember that `key` should be unique and stable
- For the Todo component, think about state structure first before coding
- Take all scheduled breaks - they help with retention
- Practice explaining your code out loud as you write it (interview prep!)
