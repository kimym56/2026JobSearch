## 📊 Job Applications

Applications submitted today:
- [ ] Company Name - Role - Date - Status (📝/📤/📞/👔/✅/❌)

Applications followed up:
- [ ] Company Name - Action taken - Result

Total this week: ___ (Goal: 3-5)

## 🧮 Algorithms Solved (Night Before)

Problems reviewed in evening session:

1. Search in Rotated Sorted Array (33, M) - Rotated-array binary search review - 35 min
2. Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array (34, M) - Left/right boundary search - 40 min

Patterns practiced:
- Pattern 1: Binary search on monotonic condition
- Pattern 2: Dual boundary search (first occurrence vs. last occurrence)
- Pattern 3: Tradeoff analysis across different valid implementations

Difficulties encountered:
- Switching templates mid-problem caused pointer update mistakes
- Some reviewed solutions optimized readability at the cost of easy debugging

---

## 💡 Key Patterns & Learnings

Today's key insights:

1. **Weekly Review Sharpens Pattern Recognition**: Reviewing others' solutions exposed alternative binary-search templates and tradeoffs.
2. **Simulation Reveals Communication Gaps**: Time pressure highlighted where explanation quality drops even when code is acceptable.
3. **Key Stability in React**: Stable keys are not just warnings; they directly control state preservation and user-facing behavior.

Connections to previous days:
- This day integrates binary-search fundamentals (Day 14) with interview execution practice

Questions to revisit:
- Which simulation rubric should be tracked weekly (accuracy, speed, clarity)?
- What default communication structure is most reliable for timed interviews?
