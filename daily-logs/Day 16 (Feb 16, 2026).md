# Day 16: Monday, Feb 16, 2026 - Special Catch-up Sprint (Hybrid)

**Theme:** Prefix/Hash algorithm block + backend/react restart
**Goal:** Keep original catch-up tasks and add algorithm test progress (5 problems)

---

## Today's Progress

- [x] **Algorithm Problems Solved**: 1 / 5
- [ ] **Backend-learning docs reviewed**: ___ / 2
- [ ] **React docs resumed after Context**: done / not yet
- [ ] **Interview questions block completed**: yes / no

---

## Sprint Rules for Today

- [ ] Keep original catch-up plan active (not algorithm-only)
- [ ] 35-minute hard stop per algorithm problem
- [ ] No explain-aloud
- [ ] No written consolidation
- [ ] No job application block (Friday-only)

---

## Time Plan (Start 4:00 PM, ~6.5h)

- **4:00 - 4:20:** Setup
  - [ ] Confirm problem queue + timer
  - [ ] Confirm backend docs queue

- **4:20 - 6:05:** Algorithm Test Block A
  - [ ] Subarray Sum Equals K (560, M)
  - [ ] Find Pivot Index (724, E)
  - [ ] Continuous Subarray Sum (523, M)

- **6:05 - 6:20:** Break

- **6:20 - 7:05:** Backend-learning Block 1
  - [ ] `backend-learning/evaluations/02-nestjs-backend.md`
  - [ ] `backend-learning/evaluations/03-agent-manager.md`

- **7:05 - 7:35:** Dinner

- **7:35 - 8:45:** Algorithm Test Block B
  - [ ] Range Sum Query 2D - Immutable (304, M)
  - [ ] Longest Consecutive Sequence (128, M)

- **8:45 - 9:30:** React Docs Restart
  - [ ] Resume after Context section
  - [ ] Focus: reducer/context recap + rendering optimization section entry

- **9:30 - 10:30:** Interview Questions Block
  - [ ] JS/React 10-question timed drill
  - [ ] Mark only weak tags (no written consolidation)
