- **Authentication**: Verifying the identity of a user or system
- **Authorization**: Determining what an authenticated user is allowed to do

## C

- **Celery**: A distributed task queue for Python, used for background job processing
- **Component**: A reusable UI element in React, or a modular part of the page data structure

- **DTO**: Data Transfer Object - Object that carries data between processes
- **Docker**: Platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers

## E

- **Entity**: In TypeORM, a class that maps to a database table
- **Environment Variables**: Configuration values set outside of the code

## F

- **FastAPI**: Modern Python web framework for building APIs
- **Frontend**: The client-side of a web application (React/Next.js in this project)

## G

- **Gateway**: In NestJS WebSocket, handles WebSocket connections and events

## J

- **JWT**: JSON Web Token - A compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred

## L

- **LangChain**: Framework for building applications with large language models
- **LLM**: Large Language Model - AI model like GPT-4

## M

- **Microservices**: Architecture style that structures an application as a collection of services
- **Module**: In NestJS, a class annotated with `@Module()` that organizes application structure
- **Middleware**: Functions that have access to request and response objects

- **REST**: Representational State Transfer - Architectural style for APIs

## S

- **Service**: In NestJS, a class with `@Injectable()` decorator that contains business logic
- **Session**: Temporary interaction information between user and system
- **Socket.IO**: Library for real-time bidirectional communication
- **Swagger**: OpenAPI Specification for documenting APIs
