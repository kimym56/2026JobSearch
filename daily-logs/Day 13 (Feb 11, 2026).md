Applications followed up:
- [ ] Company Name - Action taken - Result

Total this week: ___ (Goal: 3-5)

## 🧮 Algorithms Solved (Night Before)

Problems solved in evening review session:

1. Reverse Linked List (206, E) - Iterative pointer reversal - 35 min
2. Remove Nth Node From End of List (19, M) - Two pointers + dummy node - 45 min

Patterns practiced:
- Pattern 1: Iterative pointer rewiring with `prev`/`curr`/`next`
- Pattern 2: Fast-slow pointer gap to find deletion target
- Pattern 3: Dummy head to simplify edge cases at the list head

Difficulties encountered:
- Edge case when removing the first node
- Pointer update order causing temporary cycle/overwrite mistakes

---

## 💡 Key Patterns & Learnings

Today's key insights:

1. **Linked List Pointer Discipline**: Correct pointer update order matters more than syntax speed.
2. **Dummy Node Reliability**: Dummy heads eliminate special-case branching and reduce bugs.
3. **Pilates Day Energy Management**: Front-load deep work and keep the late block narrowly scoped.

Connections to previous days:
- Linked list extends stack/queue pointer thinking into mutation-heavy data structures

Questions to revisit:
- Recursive vs. iterative linked-list reversal trade-offs in interviews?
- Most reliable binary-search boundary template (`[l, r]` vs. `[l, r)`) for personal use?
