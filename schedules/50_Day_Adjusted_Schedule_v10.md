# Full-Stack Engineer Preparation - Side Project + Frontend Job Prep (Rescheduled v10 - Feb 16-18 Hybrid Catch-up Sprint)

**Date:** Feb 15, 2026
**Changes from v9:** Converted Feb 16-18 (previously holiday/off-plan days) into a 3-day hybrid catch-up sprint with algorithm tests. Original catch-up tasks are preserved, and algorithm scope is locked to unsolved Person B/C backlog for non-binary-search categories with binary search Person A only (`704`, `153`). No explain-aloud, no written consolidation, and no job application blocks during Feb 16-18.

Start date: Monday, Jan 26, 2026
End date: Thursday, Mar 05, 2026
Weekends (Sat/Sun) are rest days.

## Scheduling Rules (Must Follow)
- Day starts at 10:00am.
- **10:00am**: Daily side project colleague sync (10-30 minutes).
- **10:30am-11:45am**: Algorithm study DISCUSSION (review problems solved in previous evening with colleagues) on scheduled days only.
- **After 1:00pm**: Frontend interview prep uses integrated learning structure (see daily templates).
- Side project work consolidated to afternoon focused block (4:30-7:00 PM).
- After 7:00pm: Frontend job prep deep dive and practice blocks.
- Every Wednesday: Pilates 6:00-11:00pm; home around 11:00-11:30pm.
  - Wednesday nights (11:30pm-1:00am): Solve 2 algorithm problems for Thursday morning discussion.
  - Time is tight but sufficient for focused problem-solving.
- Every Thursday: Creative Vibe Coding Lab 6:30-10:00pm; home around 11:00-11:30pm.
  - Thursday nights are intentionally light (11:30pm-1:00am only).
- React study must use the official React docs as the primary source.
- Book reading: 20-30 minutes on Tuesday (3:30-4:00 PM) + Thursday (10:30-11:00 PM).
- Portfolio site is low priority (only 1 short slot/week if core tasks are on track).
- Schedule length: 29 working days (weekends off).
- **Exception (one-time): Feb 16-18 catch-up sprint**
  - Feb 16 start: 4:00 PM (6-7h available)
  - Feb 17 start: 2:00 PM (8h available)
  - Feb 18 start: 12:00 PM (10h available)
  - These three days are hybrid catch-up days (original plan + algorithm tests), not normal full schedule execution.
  - Binary Search in this sprint is Person A only.
  - Job applications remain Friday-only (not scheduled on Feb 16-18).
- **Algorithm study schedule**:
  - Evening (Day N): Solve 2 problems independently (11:30 PM-1:00 AM on Wed/Thu, 8:30-10:00 PM other days)
  - Morning (Day N+1): Discuss previous evening's problems (10:30-11:45 AM)
  - Study days: Feb 2-6, 9-13, 19-20, 23-27 (17 days total)

## Goals (High Level)
- Build strong React implementation skills through coding assignments and implementation analysis.
- Maintain steady algorithm practice (LeetCode / Programmers / Baekjoon).
- Prepare interview questions + mock interviews in parallel with applications.
- Ship side project milestones on schedule (coordinated via daily syncs).
- **Frontend interview prep priority**: Inverted from v8 to 65% of focused time (integrated learning: concept → optional apply → flex review).

## Special Catch-up Sprint (Feb 16-18, 2026) - Hybrid Catch-up + Algorithm Tests

This 3-day sprint keeps the original catch-up tracks and adds explicit algorithm test blocks.

### Fixed Rules (Feb 16-18)
- Binary Search: solve **Person A only** (`704`, `153`).
- For non-binary-search categories: solve unsolved problems assigned to Person B/C first.
- Keep non-algorithm catch-up blocks active: React docs continuation, backend-learning docs, interview questions, and optional coding challenge/refactor.
- Use **25-minute hard stop** per algorithm problem during this sprint.
- No explain-aloud, no written consolidation, and no job application block.

### Algorithm Target Pool for Sprint (19 problems)

**Person B/C unsolved (17):**
- Sliding Window: `424`
- Prefix Sum/Diff: `560`, `523`, `724`, `304`
- Hash Map/Set: `128`, `347`, `205`, `36`
- Stack/Queue: `739`, `150`, `155`, `232`
- Linked List: `143`, `2`, `21`, `141`

**Binary Search (Person A only, 2):**
- `704`, `153`

**Week 2-3: 1 integrated mock session per week**
- Format: Core block learn → Flex review → Practice timed
- Schedule: Friday Deep Dive block (8:00-10:00 PM)
- Focus: Build interview communication stamina
- Goal: Get comfortable with interview format

**Week 4-5: 2 mock interviews per week**
- Session 1 (Tue): Coding assignment **or** implementation review focus (Deep Dive block)
- Session 2 (Fri): Interview questions focus (JS/React/system design)
- Format: Mix of self-timed review and partner sessions
- Duration: 60 minutes each
- Goal: Build clear communication under time pressure

**Week 6: 3 mock interviews (final prep)**

**Rotation Pattern:**
- Odd-numbered sessions: Coding assignment **or** implementation review (choose from `coding-challenge-progress.md`)
- Even-numbered sessions: Interview questions (JS/React/web/system design)

**Self-Review Setup (No Recording Required):**
- Review afterwards for:
  - Clear communication
  - Time management
  - Code organization
  - Questions to ask interviewer
- Note: No documentation required unless you want to keep short notes.

**Partner Mock Interview Best Practices:**
- Take turns being interviewer/interviewee
- Provide specific feedback (communication, code quality, problem-solving)
- Simulate real interview conditions (time limits, no external resources)
- Debrief: What went well? What to improve?

## Notes
- Integrated frontend prep structure (Learn → Optional Apply → Flex Review → Deep Dive → Practice → Review) ensures concepts stick.
- Core Learning Block (1:00-4:00 PM) is when your mind is freshest for new concepts.
- Side project consolidated to afternoon (4:30-7:00 PM) for focused progress without context-switching.
- Deep Dive (8:00-10:00 PM) is for interview simulation and communication practice.
- Practice (10:30 PM-12:00 AM) reinforces patterns and includes book reading.
- Review (12:00-12:30 AM) consolidates learning and sets tomorrow's focus.
- If a Wednesday or Thursday night is too late, move the remaining tasks to the next evening.
- Keep weekends fully off to avoid burnout.
- Use the day map to keep the timeline aligned with actual dates.
- Algorithm study happens at 10:30 AM on scheduled days; evenings are for review and pattern study.
