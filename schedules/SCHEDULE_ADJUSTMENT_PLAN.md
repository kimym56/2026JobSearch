# 50-Day Schedule Adjustment Plan
## Strategic Changes for Frontend Interview Success

**Created:** January 12, 2026  
**Target:** Optimize for both Frontend Coding Tests + Algorithm Tests  
**Goal:** Gold 3 Baekjoon / Level 2-3 Programmers / Medium LeetCode + React Implementation Skills

---

## 🎯 Key Changes Overview

### **What's Changing:**
1. **Days 2-9**: Remove LeetCode → Focus 100% on React mastery
2. **Days 10-20**: Add React coding challenges + Start easy algorithms
3. **Days 21-29**: Keep intensive algorithm prep (perfect timing)
4. **Days 30-50**: Add frontend mock interviews + timed challenges
5. **Daily End Time**: Move from 1:00 AM → 11:00-11:30 PM for better sleep

### **Why These Changes:**
- ✅ Frontend roles test **implementation skills MORE** than pure algorithms
- ✅ Learning React + Algorithms simultaneously is overwhelming
- ✅ Day 21-29 intensive prep gets you to target level (Gold 3/Level 2-3/Medium)
- ✅ Better sleep = better retention and performance
- ✅ Realistic interview preparation for Korean + international companies

## 📅 Revised Phase Structure

### **PHASE 1: React Foundation Only (Days 1-9)**
**Focus:** Master React without algorithm distraction  
**Goal:** Build muscle memory for components, hooks, state management

**Days 2-9 Evening Changes:**
- **OLD:** 9:00 PM - 1:00 AM → LeetCode (4 hours)
- **NEW:** 9:00 PM - 11:00 PM → React practice (2 hours)
  - Build 2-3 small components/apps per day
  - Practice: Forms, lists, conditional rendering, API calls
  - Code without tutorials - learn by doing

**Specific Activities (9:00-11:00 PM):**
- **Day 2:** Build simple React components (after course)
- **Day 3:** Recreate UI from screenshots (practice styling + React)
- **Day 4:** Build form with validation (no libraries)
- **Day 5:** Fetch & display API data (error handling, loading states)
- **Day 6:** Theme switcher + localStorage persistence
- **Day 7:** Shopping cart logic with useReducer
- **Day 8:** Todo app with CRUD operations
- **Day 9:** Mini dashboard with multiple components

**Benefits:**
- Deep React proficiency before job applications
- Less mental fatigue (no context switching)
- Better sleep schedule (11 PM instead of 1 AM)

---

### **PHASE 2: Dual Track Begins (Days 10-20)**
**Focus:** Add algorithms gradually + React coding challenges  
**Goal:** Build algorithm foundation + timed implementation practice

**Daily Structure Changes (Days 10-20):**

- Timed implementation (30 min code + 15 min review)
- Platforms: Frontend Mentor, GreatFrontEnd, LeetCode Frontend
- Practice: Autocomplete, Infinite scroll, Debounced search, Modal, Tabs, Accordion

**9:15 - 9:30 PM (15 min): Break**

**9:30 - 11:00 PM (1.5 hrs): Algorithm Practice**
- Start with Easy problems (1-2 problems)
- Focus on fundamentals: Arrays, Strings, Hash Maps, Two Pointers
- Platforms: Baekjoon (Bronze/Silver), Programmers (Level 1), LeetCode (Easy)

**Progression:**
- **Days 10-14:** 2 Easy problems/day (understand, don't rush)

---

### **PHASE 3: Algorithm Intensive (Days 21-29)**
**Keep Current Schedule - This is Perfect!**

**Why This Timing Works:**
- You have React foundation → can focus 100% on algorithms
- 9 consecutive days = massive skill jump
- Pattern recognition becomes second nature
- This phase gets you to Gold 3 / Level 2-3 / Medium level

**Daily Structure (Days 21-29):**
- Morning-Evening: Algorithm theory + practice (10-15 problems/day)
- Each day focuses on ONE pattern (Two Pointers, Sliding Window, Binary Search, etc.)
- Night: 4-5 problems to solidify learning

**Keep all current activities as-is for this phase!**

---

### **PHASE 4: Portfolio Projects + Maintenance (Days 30-39)**
**Focus:** Build interview-ready projects while maintaining algorithm skills

**Changes to Current Schedule:**

**Add Weekly Frontend Mock Interviews:**
- **Day 32 (Wed):** After Pilates → 30 min timed React challenge instead of LeetCode
- **Day 35 (Mon):** Add 1-hour frontend live coding mock
- **Day 38 (Thu):** Add 1-hour take-home style challenge (2-hour project compressed)

**Daily Algorithm Adjustment:**
- Reduce from 3 problems → 2 problems/day
- Use saved time for:
  - Code review of your projects
  - Refactoring for best practices
  - Adding tests

**Project Week Focus:**
- Your projects ARE your frontend coding test prep
- Build them as if they're take-home assignments
- Time yourself: Can you build similar features in 2-4 hours?
- Practice explaining your code out loud

---

### **PHASE 5: Interview Ready (Days 40-50)**
**Focus:** Applications + Interview simulation

**Add These Activities:**

**Frontend Mock Interviews (2-3 times/week):**
- **Tue/Thu evenings:** 45-min timed React implementation
- Use Pramp or practice with friends
- Record yourself coding and explaining

**Algorithm Practice:**
- Continue 3-4 problems/day
- Mix: 2 Medium + 1-2 Easy (maintenance + challenge)
- Focus on explaining solutions out loud

**Weekly Schedule Template:**

**Monday/Wednesday/Friday:**
- Morning-Evening: Applications + networking
- Night: 3-4 algorithm problems

**Tuesday/Thursday:**
- Morning-Evening: Applications + company research
- 7:30-8:30 PM: Dinner
- 8:30-9:30 PM: Frontend mock interview (45 min implementation + review)

2. **Code without tutorials** - resist the urge to look things up
3. **Explain out loud** - practice talking through your code
4. **Focus on fundamentals** - hooks, state, props, component composition
5. **Handle edge cases** - empty states, errors, loading

**For Algorithm Tests:**
1. **Start Day 21** - don't rush, you'll catch up fast
2. **Focus on patterns** - not memorization
3. **Use all three platforms** - Baekjoon (Korean standard), Programmers (realistic), LeetCode (learning)
4. **Explain solutions** - write comments, talk through approach
5. **Review mistakes** - every wrong answer is a learning opportunity

**For Sleep:**
1. **11 PM cutoff** - better to sleep than cram
2. **Weekends OFF** - non-negotiable
3. **Wednesday Pilates** - keep this, it's crucial for mental health
