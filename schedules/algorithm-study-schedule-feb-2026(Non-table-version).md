# Algorithm Study Schedule (LeetCode) — Feb 2026

Start date: Monday, Feb 02, 2026
End date: Thursday, Mar 05, 2026
No study on weekends or Feb 16–18 (Korean holiday).

## Rules

- 3 people total (Person A, Person B, Person C).
- Each study day: same category for everyone, but each person solves **2 different problems**.
- Target: 2 problems per person per day (total 6 problems/day).
- Use LeetCode; choose problems with similar difficulty per person.
- Difficulty tags: E = Easy, M = Medium, H = Hard.
- Checkbox legend: `[ ]` not started, `[x]` solved, `[~]` needs review.
- Status tag: add `(suboptimal)` after a solved item if the approach works but needs improvement.
- Timebox per problem: 35 minutes (hard stop, then review/learn).
- Daily review: 10–15 minutes to revisit 1 previous mistake/problem.
- Weekly timed set: once per week, 2 problems in 60–75 minutes.
- Friday review: review the week's problems solved by other people (no new problems assigned).
- Difficulty mix target: 1 Easy + 1 Medium per person per day (allow occasional Medium+Medium or 1 Hard as a stretch).
