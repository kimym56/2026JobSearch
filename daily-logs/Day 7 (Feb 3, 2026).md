Applications followed up:
- [ ] Company Name - Action taken - Result

Total this week: ___ (Goal: 3-5)

---

## 🧮 Algorithms Solved (Night Before)

Problems solved in morning discussion:
1. Valid Palindrome (125) - Two Pointers - Clean O(n) solution
2. Move Zeroes (283) - Two Pointers - In-place modification

Patterns practiced:
- Pattern 1: Left/right pointer convergence (palindrome check)
- Pattern 2: Fast/slow pointer or read/write pointer (move zeroes)
- In-place array modification techniques

Difficulties encountered:
- Edge cases: Empty string, single character, all same characters
- Space optimization: Avoiding extra arrays

---

## 💡 Key Patterns & Learnings

Today's key insights:

1. **Two Pointer Pattern - Left/Right Convergence**: Valid Palindrome uses two pointers starting from both ends, moving toward center. O(n) time, O(1) space. Key insight: Skip non-alphanumeric characters while comparing.

2. **Two Pointer Pattern - Read/Write Position**: Move Zeroes uses one pointer to track "zero position" and another to iterate. When non-zero found, swap with zero position. O(n) time, O(1) space. Maintains relative order of non-zero elements.

3. **Pilates Day Adjustment**: Extended afternoon block (4.5h side project) compensates for evening activity. Light algorithm practice (11:30 PM-1:00 AM) maintains study rhythm without burnout.

4. **In-Place Array Modification**: Both problems demonstrate modifying arrays without extra space. Key skill: Track position/state explicitly rather than creating new arrays.

Connections to previous days:
- Builds on array/string fundamentals from Day 6
- Two-pointer technique extends to sliding window (Day 8 topic)
- In-place optimization principles apply to many algorithm problems

Questions to revisit:
- When to use two-pointer vs. hash map for palindrome problems?
- How to identify when fast/slow pointer vs. read/write pointer is appropriate?
- Edge case handling: What if entire array is one type?
