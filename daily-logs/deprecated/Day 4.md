- **9:40 – 10:00: Immutability Drills**

## 🌤️ Afternoon Block: CSS Specificity + Responsive Design

**Time:** 3:00 PM – 5:30 PM
_Focus: Strengthen CSS fundamentals and layout confidence._

- **3:00 – 3:30:** 🚶 Break/Transition (walk, reset).

- **3:30 – 4:30: Specificity + Cascade**
  - [ ] Write 8 selector pairs and predict which wins (include IDs, classes, and element selectors).
  - [ ] Calculate specificity scores for each selector and confirm the winner.
  - [ ] Create a small HTML snippet and test overrides in DevTools.
  - [ ] Review inheritance rules for typography and layout.
  - [ ] Practice `:where()` vs `:is()` and note specificity differences.
  - [ ] Note 3 "escape hatches" you will avoid (overusing `!important`, deep nesting, inline styles).

- **4:30 – 5:30: Responsive Design Basics**
  - [ ] Build a simple 2-column layout that stacks on mobile.
  - [ ] Convert fixed sizes to fluid units (`rem`, `%`, `vw`, `clamp()`).
  - [ ] Add a breakpoint at 768px and adjust spacing + typography.
  - [ ] Use `max-width` + `margin: 0 auto` to center content.
  - [ ] Test on a narrow viewport (375px) and verify no horizontal scroll.
  - [ ] Note 2 reusable breakpoint ranges and when you’ll apply them.
