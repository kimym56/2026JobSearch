## 💡 Key Patterns & Learnings

Today's key insights:

1. **Hash Map Frequency Counting**: Count chars or items in one pass, then validate with a second pass. Great for subset problems like Ransom Note.

2. **Anagram Grouping**: Canonical keys (sorted strings or 26-length char counts) make grouping linear-time after key creation.

3. **Evaluation Agent Review**: Trajectory evaluations need clear scoring definitions + edge-case handling to avoid inconsistent results.

Connections to previous days:
- Hash maps extend arrays/strings fundamentals and enable efficient pattern checks

Questions to revisit:
- When to choose sorted-string keys vs. frequency keys for anagrams?
- How to structure evaluation metrics for explainable scoring?
