# Day 18: Wednesday, Feb 18, 2026 - Compressed Catch-up Sprint (17:00-22:00)

**Theme:** Day 16-17 unfinished work, compressed
**Goal:** Cover all remaining categories in limited time: backend (1h) + algorithm carry-over + React docs (1h) + side project (1h)

---

## Confirmed Completed from Day 17

- [x] 724, 523, 739, 155, 150, 232

## Remaining Carry-over to Cover Tonight

- **Algorithms (6):** 704, 153, 304, 128, 424, 347
- **React backlog:** Day 16 restart gap + Day 17 set (`Keeping Components Pure`, `memo/useMemo/useCallback`)
- **Backend docs:** rapid review sweep (1h)
- **Interview Q&A:** quick minimum pass only if time remains

---

## Sprint Rules (Compression Mode)

- [ ] Coverage > perfection (touch every remaining category)
- [ ] 8-10 minute hard stop per algorithm problem
- [ ] If blocked: write 1-line blocker, move immediately
- [ ] Backend review = skim + action items only
- [ ] Protect React docs block (1h) and side-project block (1h)
- [ ] No job application block (Friday-only)

---

## Time Plan (17:00-22:00, dinner included)

- **5:00 - 5:05 PM:** Setup checkpoint
  - [ ] Confirm carry-over list and timers

- **5:05 - 6:05 PM:** Backend-learning rapid sweep (1h)
  - [x] `backend-learning/evaluations/README.md`
  - [x] `backend-learning/evaluations/QUICK_START_EVALUATION.md`
  - [x] `backend-learning/evaluations/01-architecture.md`
  - [x] `backend-learning/evaluations/02-nestjs-backend.md`
  - [x] `backend-learning/evaluations/03-agent-manager.md`
  - [ ] `backend-learning/evaluations/06-database-guide.md`
  - [ ] `backend-learning/evaluations/07-environment.md`
  - [ ] `backend-learning/evaluations/08-debugging.md`
  - [ ] `backend-learning/evaluations/09-glossary.md`
  - [ ] Output: 5 action bullets only

- **6:05 - 7:00 PM:** Algorithm carry-over blitz (55m)
  - [x] Binary Search (704, E)
  - [x] Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array (153, M)
  - [x] Range Sum Query 2D - Immutable (304, M)
  - [ ] Longest Consecutive Sequence (128, M)
  - [ ] Longest Repeating Character Replacement (424, M)
  - [ ] Top K Frequent Elements (347, M)

- **7:00 - 8:00 PM:** Dinner (1h)

- **8:00 - 9:00 PM:** React Docs Focus Block (1h)
  - [ ] Day 16 React restart gap quick recovery
  - [ ] Read: `Keeping Components Pure`
  - [ ] Read: `memo` + `useMemo` + `useCallback` overview
  - [ ] Write 3 bullets: when to optimize vs not optimize

- **9:00 - 10:00 PM:** Side Project Sprint (1h)
  - [ ] Main side-project progress block
  - [ ] Apply React backlog while building:
  - [ ] Keep components pure
  - [ ] Use stable keys in rendered lists
  - [ ] Add/verify one `memo` or `useMemo/useCallback` optimization
  - [ ] Check state preserve/reset behavior once

---

## Today's Progress (Compressed Tracking)

- [ ] **Backend docs reviewed (rapid):** \_\_\_ / 9
- [ ] **Algorithms solved:** \_\_\_ / 6 (`704`, `153`, `304`, `128`, `424`, `347`)
- [ ] **React docs completed:** \_\_\_ / 1h
- [ ] **React backlog applied in side project:** yes / partial / no
- [ ] **Side project time completed:** \_\_\_ / 1h
- [ ] **Job Q&A quick pass:** \_\_\_ / 4 (only if algorithm ends early)

---

### ✅ Definition of Done (Day 18 Compressed)

1. [ ] Finish 1-hour backend docs sweep + 5 action bullets
2. [ ] Attempt all 6 remaining algorithms (solve as many as possible)
3. [ ] Complete React docs block (1h) with 3 optimization notes
4. [ ] Complete side-project block (1h) and apply React backlog concepts
5. [ ] Use leftover/early-finish minutes for quick Job Q&A only if possible

**Day type:** Hybrid catch-up sprint day 3 (compressed mode)
**Next:** Day 19 carries only unresolved algorithm/Q&A leftovers
