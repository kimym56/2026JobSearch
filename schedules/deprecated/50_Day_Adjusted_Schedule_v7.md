# Full-Stack Engineer Preparation - Side Project + Frontend Job Prep (Rescheduled v7 - Compressed to Mar 05)

Start date: Monday, Jan 26, 2026
End date: Thursday, Mar 05, 2026
Weekends (Sat/Sun) are rest days.

## Scheduling Rules (Must Follow)
- Day starts at 10:00am.
- 10:00am: Daily side project colleague sync (10-30 minutes).
- Weekdays daytime (until ~5:30-6:00pm): side project only.
- After 6:00pm: frontend job prep rotation (React docs, coding assignments, interview questions, applications, algorithms).
- Every Wednesday: Pilates 6:00-11:00pm; home around 11:00-11:30pm.
  - Wednesday nights are intentionally light (11:30pm-1:00am only).
  - No heavy coding or long algorithm sets on Wednesdays.
- Every Thursday: Creative Vibe Coding Lab 6:30-10:00pm; home around 11:00-11:30pm.
  - Thursday nights are intentionally light (11:30pm-1:00am only).
- React study must use the official React docs as the primary source.
- Book reading: 20-30 minutes on Tuesday + Thursday nights.
- Portfolio site is low priority (only 1 short slot/week if core tasks are on track).
- Schedule length: 29 working days (weekends off).

## Goals (High Level)
- Build strong React implementation skills through hands-on coding assignments.
- Maintain steady algorithm practice (LeetCode / Programmers / Baekjoon).
- Prepare interview questions + mock interviews in parallel with applications.
- Ship side project milestones on schedule (builder UI, maps, auth, store/publish).

## Side Project Roadmap (Daytime) - MOCHEONG Full-Stack + AI
Use the daily template above. The roadmap is compressed into 6 weeks to end by Thu, Mar 05, 2026.

### Week 1 (Jan 26-30): Builder Page UI First
- Implement the builder page UI end-to-end (layout, sections, editing UX)
- Define the builder data shape on the frontend to support store/publish later
- RSVP flow is explicitly TBD and only if time is left

### Week 2 (Feb 2-6): Builder Location First Half -> Auth Starts Mid-Week
- First half of the week: implement builder location + Kakao Map API integration
- Ensure the location section is easy to preview/read in the invitation UI
- Mid-week onward: start auth logic on frontend and backend and protect builder routes

### Week 3 (Feb 9-13): Auth + Builder Integration (FE + BE)
- Continue and solidify auth logic on frontend and backend
- Integrate auth with the builder page so a user can store progress or publish
- Real-time chat and the user dashboard are colleague-owned; focus only on UI tweaks if needed

### Week 4 (Feb 16-20): Store/Publish Persistence + Agent Markdown
- Design and implement store/publish endpoints and DB persistence for builder data
- Serialize builder content to Markdown and send it to the backend so the agent can understand it
- Add draft vs publish status, basic versioning, and failure handling

### Week 5 (Feb 23-27): User Features + Quality
- Implement remaining user-facing features that are not covered by your colleague
- E2E flow review: builder -> store/publish -> render/read path
- Add tests for critical flows and address performance/UX issues you notice

### Week 6 (Mar 2-5): Deployment + Polish + Finalization
- Deployment checklist/runbook, environment cleanup, and monitoring/logging sanity checks
- UI polish and responsive fixes for the most important demo flows
- Final demo prep, portfolio notes, and scope freeze

## Frontend Job Prep Plan (Evenings After 6pm)

### Evening Rotation (Parallel Tracks by Day)
Use the same daily template, but rotate focus by day so everything moves in parallel.

| Day | 6:15 - 8:45 (Block 1) | 9:15 - 10:45 (Block 2) | 11:15 - 12:45 (Algo Block) |
|-----|------------------------|------------------------|----------------------------|
| Monday | Coding-assignment interview prep | Interview questions (JS/React/web) | LeetCode / Programmers / Baekjoon |
| Tuesday | React official docs study | Coding-assignment reps (timed) | Pattern of the week + 1-2 problems |
| Wednesday | Pilates night (no standard rotation) | Light review only | Light only (1 easy max) |
| Thursday (lab night) | No standard rotation (lab 6:30-10:00) | Light review only | Light only (1 easy max) |
| Friday | Job search + applications | Mock interview (assignment or questions) | Timed set + weekly review |

Wednesday rule override:
- Pilates runs 6:00-11:00pm. Replace the standard rotation with **light review only** from 11:30pm-1:00am.

Thursday rule override:
- Lab runs 6:30-10:00pm. Replace the standard rotation with **light review only** from 11:30pm-1:00am.

Portfolio site (low priority):
- Use one short slot per week by replacing part of Friday Block 2, only if core tasks are on track.

### Book Reading Plan (Frontend + React Deep Dive)
Keep this lightweight and consistent: 20-30 minutes on Tuesday and Thursday nights.

Chapter pacing by week:
- Week 1 (Jan 26-30): Part 1, Chapters 01-05
- Week 2 (Feb 2-6): Part 2, Chapters 06-09
- Week 3 (Feb 9-13): Part 2, Chapters 10-12
- Week 4 (Feb 16-20): Part 3, Chapters 13-15
- Week 5 (Feb 23-27): Part 3, Chapters 16-17 + Part 4, Chapter 18
- Week 6 (Mar 2-5): Part 4, Chapter 19 + full review notes

How to fit it into the rotation:
- Tuesday: use the first 20-30 minutes of Block 2 for the book, then continue the planned task.
- Thursday (light): replace part of Block 1 React docs review with the book if needed.
