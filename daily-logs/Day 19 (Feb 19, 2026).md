# Day 19: Thursday, Feb 19, 2026 - Re-entry Plan (Trees + Lab Night)

**Theme:** Main-track restart + strict scope control
**Goal:** Complete Day 19 tree set (`94`, `235`) and preserve Thursday rhythm; move unfinished Day 17 items to Day 20

---

## Scope Decision (Based on Day 18)

- Day 17 unfinished work is **explicitly deferred to Day 20**
- Day 19 stays focused on:
  - Day 19 tree problems (`94`, `235`)
  - Side project core blocks
  - Lab + Thursday reading slot
- Optional only if early-finish: `128` (non-Day17 carry-over)

---

## Day 20 Carry-over Queue (From Day 17)

- [ ] Longest Repeating Character Replacement (`424`, M)
- [ ] Top K Frequent Elements (`347`, M)
- [ ] Backend docs: `06-database-guide.md`, `07-environment.md`, `08-debugging.md`, `09-glossary.md`
- [ ] React docs: `Keeping Components Pure`, `memo/useMemo/useCallback`
- [ ] Interview Q&A minimum pass

---

## Thursday Rules (Lab Constraint Mode)

- [ ] Priority order: Day 19 trees -> side project -> lab -> reading
- [ ] No mandatory Day 17 catch-up today
- [ ] 20-minute hard stop per algorithm attempt
- [ ] If blocked >7 minutes, log 1-line blocker and move
- [ ] No job application block (Friday-only)
