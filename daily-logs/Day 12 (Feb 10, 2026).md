## 📊 Job Applications

Applications submitted today:
- [ ] Company Name - Role - Date - Status (📝/📤/📞/👔/✅/❌)

Applications followed up:
- [ ] Company Name - Action taken - Result

Total this week: ___ (Goal: 3-5)

## 🧮 Algorithms Solved (Night Before)

Problems solved in evening review session:

1. Valid Parentheses (20, E) - Stack - 30 min
2. Next Greater Element I (496, E) - Monotonic Stack + Map - 45 min

Patterns practiced:
- Pattern 1: Stack for matching/validation problems
- Pattern 2: Monotonic decreasing stack for next-greater queries

Difficulties encountered:
- Handling default values when no next-greater element exists
- Choosing array vs. map trade-offs for lookup speed

---

## 💡 Key Patterns & Learnings

Today's key insights:

1. **Stack Validation Pattern**: LIFO structure is ideal for paired symbol matching and nested structure checks.
2. **Monotonic Stack Pattern**: Useful for "next greater/smaller" problems where naive nested loops are too slow.
3. **Timed Reps Under Pressure**: Strict 45-minute reps exposed where implementation speed drops (accessibility and edge cases).

Connections to previous days:
- Stack/queue builds naturally after hash map fundamentals and pattern classification

Questions to revisit:
- How to identify monotonic stack problems quickly during interviews?
- Which accessibility checks should be non-negotiable for UI coding reps?
