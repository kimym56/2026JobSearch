Applications followed up:
- [ ] Company Name - Action taken - Result

Total this week: ___ (Goal: 3-5)

---

## 🧮 Algorithms Solved (Night Before)

Problems solved in evening review session:

1. Range Sum Query (303, E) - Prefix Sum - 25 min
2. Corporate Flight Bookings (1109, M) - Prefix Sum / Difference Array - 45 min

Patterns practiced:
- Pattern 1: Prefix sum for range sum queries
- Pattern 2: Difference array to apply range updates efficiently
- Translating diff array back to prefix sums

Difficulties encountered:
- Off-by-one errors in prefix sum indexing
- Range update boundaries (l, r + 1) handling

---

## 💡 Key Patterns & Learnings

Today's key insights:

1. **Prefix Sum - Range Queries**: Precompute cumulative sums so any range sum can be answered in O(1). Watch indexing (use prefix[0] = 0, sum from 1..n).

2. **Difference Array - Range Updates**: For multiple range increment queries, update diff[l] += val, diff[r+1] -= val, then prefix sum to rebuild final values. Great for batch updates.

3. **Lab Night Adjustment**: Extended afternoon block compensates for evening activity, keeping learning momentum while protecting recovery.

Connections to previous days:
- Prefix sums build on arrays/strings fundamentals (Day 6)
- Sliding window problems often benefit from prefix sum alternatives

Questions to revisit:
- When is prefix sum better than sliding window?
- How to generalize difference arrays for 2D grids?
