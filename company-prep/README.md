## 📋 How to Create New Company Prep

When you apply to a new company:

### Step 1: Analyze Job Description

Copy the JD and identify:
- **Tech stack**: What technologies do they use?
- **Required skills**: What are must-haves vs nice-to-haves?
- **Responsibilities**: What will you actually build?
- **Interview format**: Take-home? Live coding? Both?
- **Company focus**: What's their product/mission?
- **Team size**: Startup vs enterprise?

### Step 2: Map to Challenges

From the 15 implementation challenges, pick:
- **3-5 Most Relevant**: Which challenges match their work?
- **Priority Order**: Most critical → Nice to have
- **Extra Topics**: What else to study beyond challenges?

Example for FriendliAI:
- Dashboard (observability tools)
- Data Table (metrics, logs)
- Autocomplete (model selection)
- Forms (configuration UI)

### Step 3: Create Timeline

Based on interview date:
- **1 week away**: 3 critical challenges + company research
- **2 weeks away**: 5 challenges + TypeScript + a11y deep dive
- **3+ weeks away**: All relevant challenges + portfolio polish
- **Unknown timeline**: Follow 3-week balanced schedule

### Step 4: Add Company Context

Research:
- Company blog posts
- Technical articles they've published
- GitHub repos (if open source)
- Tech stack from job boards/LinkedIn
- Competitors and positioning
- Recent news/funding
