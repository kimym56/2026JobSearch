# Day 17: Tuesday, Feb 17, 2026 - Special Catch-up Sprint (Hybrid, Backlog-Closure)

**Theme:** Algorithm + React/backend backlog closure
**Goal:** Fully close pre-Feb16 backlog for algorithm, React docs, backend-learning docs set 1, and Job Q&A set 1

---

## Today's Progress

- [ ] **Algorithm Problems Solved**: ___ / 8
- [ ] **Day 16 carry-over completed**: ___ / 2 algorithm items
- [ ] **React backlog sections completed**: ___ / 2 (Day 12 missed set)
- [ ] **Backend-learning backlog docs completed**: ___ / 8 (`README`, `QUICK_START_EVALUATION`, `01`, `02`, `06`, `07`, `08`, `09`)
- [ ] **Job Q&A minimum quota completed**: ___ / 8 questions (source-locked)

---

## Sprint Rules for Today

- [ ] Keep hybrid catch-up plan active (not algorithm-only)
- [ ] Priority order: Algorithm -> React docs -> Backend-learning -> Job Q&A
- [ ] **25-minute hard stop per algorithm problem**
- [ ] Prioritize Day 16 carry-over before new tasks
- [ ] Job Q&A is lower depth, but minimum quota is mandatory (8 questions)
- [ ] Job Q&A source lock: `ExpectedQuestions.md` + `ExpectedQuestionsAnswers.md`
- [ ] No explain-aloud
- [ ] No written consolidation
- [ ] No job application block (Friday-only)
