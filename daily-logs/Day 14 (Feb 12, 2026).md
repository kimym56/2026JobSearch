## 🧮 Algorithms Solved (Night Before)

Problems solved in evening review session:

1. Binary Search (704, E) - Binary search fundamentals - 35 min
2. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array (153, M) - Pivot-based binary search - 45 min

Patterns practiced:
- Pattern 1: Closed interval binary search with explicit loop invariant
- Pattern 2: Pivot discovery in rotated arrays via ordered half detection
- Pattern 3: Boundary movement discipline (`left = mid + 1` vs. `right = mid`)

Difficulties encountered:
- Off-by-one mistakes on loop exit and return conditions
- Midpoint updates that can skip valid answers

---

## 💡 Key Patterns & Learnings

Today's key insights:

1. **Binary Search Invariants First**: Defining what range still contains the answer prevents random pointer movement.
2. **Rotated Array Logic**: Checking which side is sorted each step keeps pivot problems manageable.
3. **Lab-Night Timeboxing**: Front-loading side-project work keeps momentum while preserving evening energy.

Connections to previous days:
- Binary search complements linked-list pointer discipline with stricter boundary reasoning

Questions to revisit:
- Which personal template is most reliable under pressure: `[l, r]` or `[l, r)`?
- How should duplicates change rotated-array logic?
