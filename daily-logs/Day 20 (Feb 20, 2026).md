# Day 20: Friday, Feb 20, 2026 - Weekly Review + Graph BFS/DFS + Carry-over Closure

**Theme:** Friday execution with strict scope lock
**Goal:** Complete Friday review flow, solve Day 20 graph set (`200`, `733`), and close the highest-priority Day 17 carry-over items

---

## Scope Lock (Day 20)

- Friday review mode stays active in the morning (review others' problems first)
- Day 20 graph solving (`200`, `733`) remains mandatory in late-night solving block
- Day 17 carry-over is processed with minimum-pass targets (not perfection)
- Priority order:
  1. Friday review block
  2. Graph BFS/DFS pair (`200`, `733`)
  3. Day 17 carry-over algorithms (`424`, `347`)
  4. React/backend carry-over minimum pass
  5. Job applications (Friday-only)

## Day 17 Carry-over Queue (From Day 19)

- [ ] Longest Repeating Character Replacement (`424`, M)
- [ ] Top K Frequent Elements (`347`, M)
- [ ] Backend docs: `06-database-guide.md`, `07-environment.md`, `08-debugging.md`, `09-glossary.md`
- [ ] React docs: `Keeping Components Pure`, `memo/useMemo/useCallback`
- [ ] Interview Q&A minimum pass (`8` questions)

---

## Friday Rules (Execution Mode)

- [ ] 20-minute hard stop per algorithm attempt
- [ ] If blocked >7 minutes, write 1-line blocker and switch approach
- [ ] No extra optional problems until `200` and `733` are done
- [ ] Job applications are allowed today (Friday-only lane)
- [ ] Keep simulation timing strict (45 min assignment + 45 min Q&A)
