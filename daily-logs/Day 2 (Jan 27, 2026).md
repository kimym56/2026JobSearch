## 🌅 Morning Block: Side Project — Entities + Migrations

**Time:** 9:00 AM – 12:00 PM
_Focus: Convert yesterday’s drafts into real code you can build on_

- **9:00 – 9:15: Plan the day**
  - [ ] Define 1–2 concrete backend outcomes (for example: “entities compile + first migration runs”)
  - [ ] List the minimum entities and fields to implement today

- **9:15 – 12:00: TypeORM Entities (First Pass)**
  - [ ] Implement core entities: `User`, `Invitation`, `ChatRoom`, `Message`
  - [ ] Add key relationships (user-invitation, room-messages, sender-message)
  - [ ] Create and run the first migration (or document blockers clearly)
  - [ ] Capture TODOs inline for anything you intentionally defer

- **12:00 – 1:00:** 🍽️ Lunch

## 🌤️ Afternoon Block: Side Project — Auth Direction + UI Shell

**Time:** 1:00 PM – 5:30 PM
_Focus: Reduce ambiguity — pick a direction and scaffold it_

- **1:00 – 3:30: Auth Baseline + Integration Notes**
  - [ ] Decide the auth “shape” for now (JWT-only first, Firebase later, or parallel)
  - [ ] Sketch the request flow: login → token → guarded route
  - [ ] Add a minimal auth module skeleton (interfaces, guards, or placeholders)
  - [ ] Write a short “Auth Decisions (Day 2)” note in project docs

- **3:30 – 4:00:** 🚶 Break

- **4:00 – 5:30: Invitation UI Shell Scaffolding**
  - [ ] Scaffold the main invitation page layout (header, hero, sections, footer)
  - [ ] Add placeholder sections: venue, schedule, gallery, RSVP, chat
  - [ ] Wire a small static data object so the page renders end-to-end
  - [ ] Leave clear notes for what should become components later

- **5:30 – 6:00:** 🍽️ Dinner + transition

## 🌆 Evening Block: Frontend Job Prep (Day 2 Tasks)

**Time:** 6:00 PM – 1:00 AM
_Focus: React fundamentals crash course, then deliberate component reps_

- **6:00 – 8:30: React Fundamentals Crash Course**
  - [ ] Review JSX rules, props flow, and state basics
  - [ ] Practice `useState` and `useEffect` with 2 tiny examples
  - [ ] Write a short “React Fundamentals — Day 2” note with 5 rules you want to remember

- **8:30 – 9:00:** 🚶 Break

- **9:00 – 10:30: Build Components From Scratch (Round 1)**
  - [ ] Build a `Card` component with slots/sections (title, body, actions)
  - [ ] Build a `Button` component with at least 3 variants and disabled state
  - [ ] Build an `Input` component with label, helper/error text, and controlled value
  - [ ] Keep props explicit and TypeScript-friendly

- **10:30 – 11:00:** 🚶 Break

- **11:00 – 12:30: Component Polish (Round 2)**
  - [ ] Add keyboard/focus states and basic accessibility checks
  - [ ] Refactor any awkward props/API shapes
  - [ ] Create 1–2 usage examples per component (in a scratch page or notes)

- **12:30 – 1:00: Quick Review + Plan Day 3 (Challenge 01)**
  - [ ] List what’s “done enough” vs “needs follow-up”
  - [ ] Pick the exact repo/folder where Challenge 01 will live tomorrow
  - [ ] Write the first 3 steps you will take at 6:00 PM on Day 3
