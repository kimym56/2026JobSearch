## 📦 Carryover to Next Study Day

- Challenge 02 build (Counter with History)
- `useEffect` lifecycle: setup, cleanup, and dependency behavior
- Dependency arrays: stable references and avoiding infinite loops
- ES6+ essentials: destructuring, spread/rest, default params
- Array method selection: `map` vs `forEach`, `filter` vs `find`, `reduce` patterns
- Immutability in JS arrays and objects
